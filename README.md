CitiBike Analysis using Tableau

CITIBIKE ANALYSIS – SUMMARY & FINDINGS

INTRO:  For this study I used the data that was collected by the CitiBike program in New York City.  The data that was used can be found at https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data.  For the ease of setting up the models I only used four months of data (January and July of 2019 and 2020).  However, the visualizations could be run on much larger datasets.  Also, the data was concatenated together using a simply python script for ease of use when loading into Tableau.

FINDINGS – MAP VISUALIZATIONS:

1.)	One fact that was uncovered by creating a map visualization that showed the average trip time (in minutes) by each CitiBike station is that the average trip time increases as you get further away from the city center in Manhattan.  So, the trips that are taken closer to Midtown are much shorter than the trips that are taken as you get north of Central Park (Bronx area) and also into Queens.  It is possible that some of the trips that are taken from further out of the city are commuters heading into the city…or it simply could just be that people that use the bike share program in Manhattan just don’t have as far to go.  We were also able to discover that the most used station in terms of number of trips taken is the station located at Pershing Square North.  In the four months that we analyzed, Pershing Square North was responsible for 41,960 trips taken…which comes out to an average of about 338 trips per day…or about 1 trip every 5 minutes.

2.)	In a follow up map visualization, we were able to show that the number of trips increases dramatically as you get closer to the city center in Manhattan.  So, while the length of trips near Midtown is shorter on average…the number of trips is significantly greater than on the outskirts of the city.

3.)	We had two follow up map visualizations which were able to show the top 25 and the bottom 25 CitiBike stations with regard to average trip times.  This was able to confirm our findings that the stations with the longest trip times tend to all be on the outskirts of Manhattan.

FINDINGS – CITIBIKE USAGE BY AGE, GENDER, & USER TYPE:

1.)	Another fact that was uncovered is that the average trip time definitely increases in the summer months.  We were able to find that in both 2019 and 2020 the average trip time increased in July as compared to January.  In 2019 the average trip time increased by about 5 minutes and in 2020 the average trip time increased by about 13 minutes.

2.)	We were also able to determine that the CitiBike program is getting more popular!  The total sum of all trips taken in the months that we analyzed in 2019 was about 835,735 hours.  However, the total sum of all trips taken in the months that we analyzed in 2020 was about 1,198,959 hours.  That is in an increase of about 363,224 total hours!

3.)	We also analyzed the user type, and that was able to produce good news as well.  We found that while the subscriber count remained relatively stable…we were able to increase the number of “customers” from 2019 to 2020.  So, this could very well mean that people are starting to give the CitiBike program a try…and they very well could lead to being subscribers in the future.

4.)	Lastly, we were able to discover that the CitiBike program is most frequently used by people between the ages of 25 and 35.  More specifically, males between those ages.  Our highest usage for both males and females are people that are 30 years old (born in 1990).

SUMMARY:

Based on our total findings it looks like the health of the CitiBike program is doing very well.  We have increased usage from 2019 to 2020…which is impressive considering there was a global pandemic during 2020 that is most likely responsible for driving the numbers down even more than during an average year.  The bulk of our business comes from stations that are located near the city center in Manhattan and it would be good to make sure that those stations are well taken care of and monitored throughout the year.  If any maintenance needs to be performed on the bikes themselves or the station locations…that work should be completed during the winter months as that is when ridership is at its lowest.  If we could increase ridership for people above the age of 50 or below the age of 21, we could see a significant growth in the total usage overall.  However, it seems as if the CitiBike program is headed in the right direction!

Thank you for reading my report!
